        <p class="govuk-body">
          If your development <span class="govuk-!-font-weight-bold">does not</span> fall into any of these categories, you only need to download the flood map for planning on this page showing your flood zone to include in your planning application.

          You can still use this service to request flood risk data (also known as a product 4). You should receive your data within 20 working days. However, as your site is in flood zone 1, it's unlikely there will be any data available.
