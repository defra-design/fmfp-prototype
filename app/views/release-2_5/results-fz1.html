        Land within flood zone 1 has a low probability of flooding from rivers and the sea. </p>
      <p class="govuk-body"> Most developments that are less than 1 hectare (ha) in flood zone 1 do not need a flood risk assessment (FRA) as part of the planning application. The site you have drawn is 0.85 ha.
