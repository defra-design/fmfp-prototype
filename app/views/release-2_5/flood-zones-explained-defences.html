      Flood zones and what they mean
      </h1>

      <p class="govuk-body">
        Flood zones are based on a locationâ€™s chance of flooding from rivers or the sea in any year. They are used in the planning process to decide how likely it is a development could flood.
      </p>

      <p class="govuk-body">
        Flood zones do not take into account other sources of flooding. This means a site in flood zone 1 could still flood.
      </p>

      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">
        Flood zone 1
      </h2>

      <p class="govuk-body">
        Locations in flood zone 1 have a low probability of flooding. This means in any year they have a 0.1% chance of flooding in any year.
      </p>

      <p class="govuk-body">
        Some flood zone 1 developments need a flood risk assessment as part of their planning application. Find out <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/flood-risk-assessment-for-planning-applications?_ga=2.259503306.1978570411.1573555009-902236253.1554453719&_gac=1.182218197.1570532269.CjwKCAjw5_DsBRBPEiwAIEDRW7EfP37Wg2AzLlBkZNTpdinb3-amc1875cjdwiLaU-qXZCN8vsz9VhoC2QUQAvD_BwE#when-you-need-an-assessment">when you need a flood risk assessment for development in flood zone 1</a>.

      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">
        Flood zone 2
      </h2>

      <p class="govuk-body">
        Locations in flood zone 2 have a medium probability of flooding. This means in any year they have between a 1.0% and 0.5% chance of flooding from rivers or the sea.
      </p>

      <p class="govuk-body">
        Flood zone 2 developments need a flood risk assessment as part of their planning application.
      </p>

      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">
        Flood zone 3
      </h2>

      <p class="govuk-body">
        Locations in flood zone 3 have a high probability of flooding. This means there is a 1% of more chance of flooding from rivers or the sea.
      </p>

      <p class="govuk-body">
        Flood zone 3 developments need to submit a flood risk assessment as part of their planning application. This determines if the site is flood zone 3a or 3b.
      </p>

      <p class="govuk-body">
        Find out <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/flood-risk-and-coastal-change#table1" class="govuk-link">how flood zone 3a and 3b are defined</a>.

        Flood defences
      </h2>

  <p class="govuk-body">
      There are flood defences in part or all of the location you selected.</p>
      <p class="govuk-body">
      Flood defences:</p>
      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>reduce the probability of flooding from a specific source (a river or the sea), but do not completely remove the risk</li>
        <li>can fail or a flood that is bigger than the one the defence is designed to protect against could happen
</li>
  <li>    may provide reduced protection over time because of climate change increasing flood risk in the future</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="govuk-body">
    There are different types of flood defence. They include:</p>
      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>culverts</li>
        <li>embankments</li>
          <li>flood walls</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="govuk-body">
        You can view a complete list of flood defences, called asset categories, on <a class="govuk-link" href="https://environment.data.gov.uk/asset-management/drl-app/revision/current/categories#Defences">environment.data.gov.uk</a>.
