        Flood zones explained
      </h1>

      <p class="govuk-body">
        Flood zones are based on how likely it is that a location will flood from rivers and the sea. They are used in development planning and flood risk assessments.</p>
        <p class="govuk-body">Flood zones do not take into account:</p>
        <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
          <li>the impacts of climate change </li>
  <li>where flood defences are</li>
  <li>other sources of flooding</li>
  </ul>
    <p class="govuk-body">For more information about the possible causes of flooding <a class="govuk-link" href="https://check-long-term-flood-risk.service.gov.uk/postcode">check the long term flood risk for this area</a>.

        Flood zone 1
      </h2>

      <p class="govuk-body">
        Locations have a low probability of flooding, some locations will need a flood risk assessment.

      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">
        Flood zone 2
      </h2>

      <p class="govuk-body">
        Locations have a medium probability of flooding. Developments will need a flood risk assessment.
      </p>

      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">
        Flood zone 3
      </h2>

      <p class="govuk-body">
        Locations have a high probability of flooding. Developments will need a flood risk assessment.

      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">
        Flood defences
      </h2>

  <p class="govuk-body">
      There are flood defences in part or all of the location you selected.</p>
      <p class="govuk-body">
      Flood defences:</p>
      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>reduce the probability of flooding from a specific source (a river or the sea), but do not completely remove the risk</li>
        <li>can fail or a flood that is bigger than the one the defence is designed to protect against could happen
</li>
  <li>    may provide reduced protection over time because of climate change increasing flood risk in the future</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="govuk-body">
    There are different types of flood defence. They include:</p>
      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>culverts</li>
        <li>embankments</li>
          <li>flood walls</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="govuk-body">
        You can view a complete list of flood defences, called asset categories, on <a class="govuk-link" href="https://environment.data.gov.uk/asset-management/drl-app/revision/current/categories#Defences">environment.data.gov.uk</a>.
